//STATES:

//array of user guesses
//number you are trying to guess
// Make a guess vs. hot/cold/warm etc.

//Complete: 
//1. added function stubs
//2. feedback now reflects state
//3. Added CSS files
//4. Their guess should be appended to the user-guesses section (state of userGuesses should be updated).
//5. //When new game gets clicked:
			//1. State gets reset to default state.
			//2. Current guess # gets reset.
